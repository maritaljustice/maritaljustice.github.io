	<h1>Legal harassment using 498a</h1>
	<div class="page-content"><p>Section 498a IPC was enacted to empower women and make it easier for the wife to seek redress from potential harassment by the husband&#39;s family. However, this law on dowry prohibition has come under severe criticism as this has been allegedly misused by unscrupulous women for vested interests in India and abroad. False implication in a criminal case, unjustified arrests, innocents suffering the stigma of criminals, loss of livelihood, social ostracization, and most of all a merciless attack on innocent people&#39;s dignity -- all qualify as gross violation of Human Rights. in real life, despite stipulations by United Nations, as well as Indian Government&#39;s attempt at protecting Human Rights, 3.5 million women were arrested in India in last 7 years under a law meant for protection of women themselves. Those arrested also included senior citizens, pregnant women and children. </p>
<p>Section 498a of the Indian Penal code is a law that was passed by Indian Government in 1983 in response to dowry related cruelty and harassment of brides. At that time the Indian community hailed its creation and expected the law to end the concept of dowry. Although this law was meant to protect wives, it has been abused blatantly, more so in the last decade. </p>
<p>Section 498A makes the assumption that the husband and his family are presumed to be guilty of the alleged crime. The legal system considers all complaints filed by the wives to be genuine and immediately actionable. The same is achieved easily as this law is a cognizable offence and hence local police have little or no way of rejecting a complaint. Under the Section 498a, there is a guaranteed loss of dignity, liberty and freedom of husbands and their families. Since 498a is non-bailable, husbands and/or their families are arrested and jailed immediately requiring neither a prima facie investigation nor presentation of probable cause to the magistrate. It wont be wrong to say that filing this case is as easy as ordering a Pizza in London. There is no penalty or fine for the misuse of 498A IPC or any legal repercussions even if the allegations are found to be fabricated and lies. </p>
<p>The law states that whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine.
For the purpose of this section, “cruelty” means:</p>
<p> (a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman; or</p>
<p> (b) harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand.</p>
<p>The offence under section 498a is cognizable (an offence in which the police has to register a report and is empowered to arrest the husband without a court issued warrant), non-bailable (the husband can be arrested and jailed without warrant and the court decides whether to grant bail or remand the husband in custody) and non-compoundable (wife does not have the right to withdraw the complaint later).</p>
<p>In more than 95% of the cases the husband has not been found guilty. Logically speaking if dowry was taken, why was the other person not charged for his offences? A lot of women have misused this law to get lakhs of rupees out of their husbands. End of the day, if you do get trapped, it will not only be you, but also your parents who may end up going to jail for absolutely no fault of yours.</p>
<p>There has been a gradual rise in awareness of this issue in the mainstream media. A commercial movie by the name <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2417504/">498a: The wedding gift</a> (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhkTebVYZdU">trailer</a>) shows the plight of NRI husbands and their families when they are slapped with false charges of taking dowry and physically assaulting wives. Ms Deepika Bharadwaj, a media professional is also in the process of creating a documentary <a href="http://www.martyrsofmarriage.com/">Martyrs of Marriage</a> (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bGirYN2z4E">trailer</a>).</p>
