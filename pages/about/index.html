	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<div class="page-content"><p>We are a group of professionals from various backgrounds; from doctors to engineers, from IT professionals to media. All of us are residents of UK and have been affected either directly or indirectly by the misuse of laws and human rights violations in India. These are the laws that were once created to help the needy but now have become weapons of family destruction, husband harassment and for &#39;Legal Extortion&#39; of money. Some such laws are 498a (commonly known as dowry law), Domestic violence law and other maintenance laws.</p>
<p>Having been married to such scrupulous women and in their families, we were hit by the shock of our lives. Overnight, we were termed criminals, and feared facing jail, fines and losing our jobs. Some of us even contemplated ending our lives since we felt trapped in a system that does not consider rights of a husband, rights of a sister, or rights of a mother. One such NRI Syed Makhdoom ended his life after leaving Canada.A commercial movie by the name &#39;498a: The wedding gift&#39; is due to release on 5th July 2013. The movie shows the plight of NRI husbands and their families when they are slapped with false charges of taking dowry and physically assaulting wives.</p>
<p>Click here to view the trailor of the movie. Ms Deepika Bharadwaj, a media professional is also in the process of creating a documentary &#39;Martyrs of Marriage&#39;. First glimpses of her work can be seen here on youtube:  For more details kindly visit website www.martyrsofmarriage.com. We hence decided to come together as a group and help those who are suffering in silence and sometimes are at the brink of losing everything they have cared for, including their life. We all have suffered to a smaller or larger extent. Our families have also suffered to various degrees for faults that were never committed. We have ended up losing our professional stability, financial stability, hundreds and thousands of hard earned money, peace of mind, social image, self esteem, and at times the will to live! At least one of us has fought his way for more than 6 years and has come out of the clutches of such abuse. We empathise with all those who are still stuck in the rotten system and feel disheartened. We encourage all those in such horrifying circumstances to come forward from the depths of darkness and see the light at the end of tunnel. We offer a shoulder to lean on, a listening ear and at times legal, moral and social support. As a group we have decided to offer emergency residential accommodation free of cost to any male victims of such law abuse in the UK. If you require accommodation in North- kindly contact Dinesh and those needing it in South- kindly contact Hardik. For contact details, please check the Contact Us webpage.</p>
<p>Due to continued misuse of gender biased laws in India, more and more NRIs are joining us from all walks of life, all ages, professional and educational backgrounds and all religions.We have also contacted the UK government and are in the process of getting formally registered as a charity. As a group we have created an e-petition to the UK government. Please sign it to save lives and stop human rights violations in India.Please Click here to see the e-petition.</p>
